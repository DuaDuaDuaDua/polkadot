//! Binary used for simnet nodes, supports all runtimes, although only polkadot is implemented currently.
//! This binary accepts all the cli args the polkadot binary does, Only difference is it uses
//! manual-sealâ„¢ and babe for block authorship, it has a no-op verifier, so all blocks recieved over the network
//! are imported and executed straight away. Block authorship/Finalization maybe done by calling the `engine_createBlock` &
//! `engine_FinalizeBlock` rpc methods respectively.
